# Gracile

A digital musical instrument made in [raylib](https://www.raylib.com), with control similar to a [hurdy gurdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdy-gurdy).

To play this, press a note, ranging from `Z` to `N` horizontally for the 4th octave, or ranging from `Q` to `U` horizontally for the 5th octave on the standard `QWERTY` keyboard, and move the mouse around in the windows.
The loudness depends on the speed of the mouse.
